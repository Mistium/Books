Some book projects i wrote a whileeeee ago

Sirin
  Much more polished compared to Cactus clan related Stuff.
  Unfinished but has a lot of lore and worldbuilding.

  Sirin Veligi comes first in the lore but there's a lot of events between Sirin Veligi and then mastery.
  They both function as standalone stories but they are both unfinished.

Cactus Clan
  A proper finished story but not as polished as Sirin.
  This whole world is a lot more chaotic and very much like some kind of op isekai shit lmao.

Investiture
  A small fan sotry i wrote in the world of Mistborn (series by Brandon Sanderson) I love the world and the magic systems so i wanted to give it a shot myself.

Globe
  Mini book where the main point was the world building not the plot itself and it really shows
  Set within a self contained "Universe" inside of a truly massive sphere with steampunk technology
  I love this entire world but i dont love the story i wrote in it.
