The night sky above me danced with vibrant hues, a tapestry of neon that assaulted my weary eyes. Towering skyscrapers reached for the heavens, their silhouettes etched against the dark expanse. The bustling streets teemed with life, a symphony of shuffling footsteps and murmured conversations that filled my ears. A multitude of bright signs adorned the buildings that flanked me, their radiance casting an otherworldly glow. With a surge of Allomantic power, I leaped forward, pushing against the embedded metal lines that adorned the pathways beneath me. Hovering cars traversed the air above, their ethereal existence owed to these very lines.

Within me, the comforting warmth of steel burned, a constant reminder of my connection to this power. The mists swirled around, drawing closer, as I surrendered myself to the ebb and flow of Allomancy. Retrieving a metal vial from my side, I raised it to my lips, consuming the concoction of water and tin flakes within. Checking the necrosil bracers adorning my arms, I noted the investiture within, its capacity at half-full. Reaching deep within myself, I tapped into the second metal store, igniting a secondary warmth that illuminated the mists, allowing me to pierce their supernatural shroud. Their tendrils wrapped around me, enshrouding me in their secrecy, concealing my actions from prying eyes.

The tassels of my Mist-Cloak fluttered around me, mingling with the very air I moved through. This flowing garment had experienced a resurgence in popularity, a reminder of days long past, before the world crumbled beneath its own weight.

Exerting my will, I propelled myself upward, the glow of neon signs providing a backdrop to my ascent. Onlookers gazed up, their expressions a mix of awe and trepidation. The recent surge in governmental regulations had stripped Allomancy of its freedom, reserving its power for those sanctioned by the constabulary. I bore no allegiance to these newly imposed constraints, for it was the constabulary that pursued me relentlessly. Fanning the flames of iron, a third metal within me, I drew metals toward me, seizing hold of a bar above my apartment window, hurtling upward. With a deft motion, I manipulated an allomantic latch, causing the window to swing open. Guided by my instincts, I adjusted my trajectory and slipped through the aperture with ease.

Grimacing, I decelerated swiftly, colliding with the stack of mattresses I had strategically placed against the back wall. Retrieving my belongings from the dim and stifling room, I flung the door open, knowing time was of the essence. With a firm grip on the metal handrail behind me, I braced myself, exerting force against both the window and the handrail simultaneously. Inevitably, one would yieldâ€”either the unyielding metal, the glass pane, or myself. After a moment of intense exertion, the window succumbed to the surge of power, tearing away from its frame. Three agents who had been closing in on me were unceremoniously thrown backward by the resulting blast.

Casting a quick glance over my shoulder, I vaulted the railing, cascading down the spiraling descent. As the ground raced closer, I pushed against the floor below and pulled on the handrail above, propelling myself sideways at the last possible instant. My body spun in mid-air, rotating gracefully before I collided with the adjacent wall. An array of metal pylons lined its surface, eagerly responding to my command. The world flipped, and I landed gracefully, my feet touching the solid ground. Without hesitation, I sprinted out of the stairwell, leaving the pursuit behind in my wake.
