“Finally,” I say to myself in the engineering room as I look down at my creation. It was a wristwatch that contained my invention, the Molecular Bond Manipulator. I tell George to come and see my invention through a BM. Around 5 minutes later he walked in and said, “what is it Dan?” He asks “I may have just created the greatest thing ever, a molecular bond manipulator or just MBM for short” I reply excitedly “Dan can you say that again but in English this time.” He says to me. “Oh sorry it basically just lets you shape shift into whatever you want” I reply. “epic that sounds really quite cool.” He says back and he leaves to go to the control room as he had said to me. I stay in the engineering room to continue building gadgets.

3 hours later

I walk back over to the control centre where I think George should be. When I get there George is unfortunately nowhere to be found. I decide to plug my robotic arms into the computer. However when I plug them in I am disappointed to find that O.D.I.N is still offline. Suddenly, I feel a jolt of energy come through the robotic arms “O.D.I.N is online” the speakers tell me “activating targeting system” A big sort of scope that showed what the aftermath of the shot would look like came up on screen and it also showed me the blast radius and also the energy percentage of O.D.I.N. I fired at the wall of the shadow feather clan and created an insanely large crater on the edge of Sam's base. "He will most likely go to check it out with a group from his clan." I say to George and he nods in agreement at my remark. "Well he is a curious person" George replies.

Meanwhile at the Shadow Feather base in the huge crater.

“move in” the shadow Phoenix said “this could be a trap somehow” The main squad began to advance on the crater that stretched halfway as far as the eye could see. “broadcast a message to the cactus clan.” he says in a very annoyed voice. “what do you wish to say Sam?” Oscar says back (2nd in command) “tell them that they just crossed the line and they will regret messing with the Shadow Feather Clan.” Sam says to him as they make their way down the inside of the crater.
