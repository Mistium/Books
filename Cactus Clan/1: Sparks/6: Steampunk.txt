I ran through the cloud of smoke as it shrouded me .The plumes of it rising into the sky blocking out the sun momentarily like some strange phenomena. The peril was high as the wind made the smoke billow across a city of Cartoria. It surged like a deadly current through the alleyways consuming anything it touched with darkness. The B3 experimental Zepheon raptor soared out of the cloud for a second before zooming back into it. There were swathes of darkness. 

"Dan where are you?"George says over the com link                                              "trying to contain a Danimal"I reply as the raptor jumps over my head and I follow it. Trapping the B3 I show it that I created the Danimals. Almost immediately it accepts that I am it's master. It stands beside me to protect me instinctively and a few minuets later as me and the raptor are walking slowly back to the ship as not to be seen by the ordinary Cartorian people  we were spotted by 3 bounty hunters and were cornered in an alley. 

"What do you want?" I ask partly annoyed as I did already know the answer to this.                                                                                                                         "To kill you" they say and immediately the Zepheon raptor attacks them. They fire on it, only slightly denting the armour as the raptor disarms one simultaneously with the other two. They all lose their weapons into the sky and then onto the tops of the buildings surrounding the alleyway, they would never get those back."So nobody sent you?"I ask and they all reply at once                                                                                                                                          "No why would we do that" they say at once                                                            "Because you are bounty hunters" I reply thinking it was kind of obvious in the fact that they take money for their services of eliminating the people you want to eliminate. However, they did seem to be telling the truth. So I tell the raptor to just throw them on a roof. I nickname it Flicker.

When we landed back at the Cacti Fortress I walked out of the jet and lowered the cargo bay, freeing the third raptor to join me. I walked towards my room using the labyrinth of passages I had created below the Cacti Fortress. When I leave the passages through a secret entrance inside of my room, the raptor follows and the other two raptors in my room turned to look. They accept the third raptor as one of the pack and allow it to lie next to them.

I say goodbye and head off to the control centre. When I arrive George is waiting for me. "So, are you ready for some mass destruction?" he asks me as I enter "it is your turn to fire O.D.I.N" I reply, and he spins in his chair to activate the computer. As it establishes a link with O.D.I.N I ask " What are we going to destroy this time?" "We are going to destroy the main Kimmi base" He replies with a little too much enthusiasm. "doesn't that seem like cheating" I say to him around 2 seconds later. "all is fair in war" he says back as he aims the target scope to the South-East where the Kimmi are located and fires O.D.I.N on the main base. Almost immediately their whole command centre is gone replaced by a huge crater. "O.D.I.N is on 3% battery, shut down activating." so that means we won't have O.D.I.N online for around 6 months I think to myself annoyed at the fact that George used it before O.D.I.N was on max power. "George you are aware you just drained O.D.I.N to 3% power making it unusable for 6 or so months." I say annoyed with how George has just basically gotten rid of our most powerful weapon. "It was on 100 when I fired it so it must be able to use more than we thought in one burst of energy." "I guess so"I say back

Suddenly there was a huge "kaboom" outside of the cacti fortress possibly even having destroyed part of the oxidium infused wall. We run through the building and out through the door into the sunlight, there were several Kimmi ships firing huge fire balls at the base. I activate the boosters in my jetpack and fly up on to the sides of one. I activate missiles and they stream out of my shoulder plating. Several of the ships fall from the sky and the other generals have taken down an equal amount. After 3 minuets there is only two left and I leap off the first one as they are both pulled straight from the sky. The Kimmi have been eliminated.
