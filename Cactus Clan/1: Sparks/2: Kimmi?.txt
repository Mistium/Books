As soon as I hear him leave the room I sit there with my suit dematerialized and I ponder the thought of why on Cartoria would I stay behind and miss out on all the fun especially if it was against my own brother (at least that is who I thought it was). Suddenly, the data stream from the computer literally just stops. I activate my suit and it materializes slowly around me. With basically only a  blank mind I could only think one thing.The Kimmi had arrived. I walk through the building and I don't even hesitate when I get to each door. The main blast door appears up ahead. I try to  hack into it, but it won't let me exit the cacti base so that I can warn George of the Kimmi's arrival. For all I know he may already know and not in a good way."stupid door" I say.

“Activate implosion spine” I say as I run away from the door so I could stand a safe distance from the door. Then I raise my hand... and fire. It was then as if a miniature black hole had just appeared for half a second in the centre of the door and then winked out of existence, I Honestly felt pretty bad for the door.Even though it was the strongest door I ever could have created, it had been ripped apart and mangled with a full half of it completely gone. I walk through the giant hole and send George a message through the com link because the door was no longer blocking my signal “the Kimmi are here”

The Shadow Feather clan had indeed attacked the cacti fortress but had for some reason run away south-west back to the safety of their base. They must have gotten scared and decided it wasn't worth the effort. When I find George he says to me “hasn’t there been a battle today?”            “yes, but I guess they want to lose to us as well though. Also O.D.I.N is offline because of their jammers.” I say. “UGH” he says annoyed                    “I know right” I reply as I check through my communication panel and see that they had sent a message to us saying that unless we hand over control of O.D.I.N immediately they will take over the cacti fortress. I showed George and he almost immediately started laughing. "they are so stupid to think that they can just ask for O.D.I.N and expect to get it" I say as I stare at their ships and chuckle "seriously they don't even have that large of a fleet of cruisers."

 As the mass of Black ships approached with their threat of overtaking the cactus fortress, I readied my implosion spines. The other cacti generals summoned their own special cactus weapon or weapons. I have 10 implosion spine shots, that is more than enough to kill their army. very suddenly, their ships have landed have landed and a writhing crowd of Black coloured armour and the soldiers within said armour spilled out of them. All of the soldiers completely ready to destroy absolutely anything that gets in their way. It was time for a proper battle. I ran at them jumping into the crowd using one of their puny heads as a step up. I dived into it. A blade coming from my left, block and stab, a blade from my right, block and stab. A warrior running at me from behind guns a-blazing “suit auto mode engage” I tell the suit. Almost instantly, 20 warriors are lying on the floor including the guy that tried to charge me. They all lie there motionless and dead around me until my robotic arms can’t extend any further.

"activate the meat grinder" I say to the suit and a few seconds later a huge cylinder forced its way out of the ground and ate up half of the ships making a huge grinding noise in the process and several hundred army members look over to see half their ships destroyed. The members who saw this happen realise they are outmatched and ran back to the remaining ships in fear of us all.

“Activate suit switch” I tell my suit “MK2”. The MK5 melts away and turns into a blocky version of the MK5 but without robotic arms that inadvertently had turned into a protection suit with basically 0 offensive capabilities other than small knives that pop out of the suit and turns me into a sort of porcupine. It was meant to protect against anything explosive or corrosive. The soldiers immediately rushed in for the kill after seeing my main weapon ,the robotic arms, were gone. The plasma cannons mounted to the closest ships fired... But when the smoke cleared, they saw me just standing there arms crossed "you got to do better than that" I yelled at them as George and the other generals began to herd them back towards the ships.  George yelled “cease fire we don’t want waste spines." My suit switched back to the MK5 when I told it to and we headed back inside.
