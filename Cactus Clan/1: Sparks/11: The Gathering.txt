As they swung, the grappling hook was hauled in and the ship came side to side with my modified jet. Well it was more like a modified commercial passenger plane to be honest. The woman inside of the opposing craft jumped over onto my jet. "I didn't know that there was such thing as female bounty hunters" I say to her as she charges me with a knife. "Well the more you know I guess" she says as I dodge her stab. Out of the opposing ship jumped a second bounty hunter this time male. "It's two to one" they say as they circle me slowly and point their melee weapons at me. "I like those odds" I say back and I lash out with my robotic arms, disarming both of them in one swipe. They back away after losing their only offensive capabilities and I grab them both by their legs and swing them upside-down while digging my third and fourth arms into the jet roof to make myself stable. I fake dropping them and they both squirm in my grip unable to free themselves. Because I was feeling merciful I dropped them back in their ship and I get back into the jet. I activate the nitro and boost away from their ship. 

I come in to land and after I had lowered the cargo doors all of the other Danimals got into the jet cargo hold and I entered using the stairway that I always use. I get into the pilot seat and we all take off to the cacti fortress. When we land George is once again standing on the Cactus Clan runway reminding me slightly of when I came back from the cog fortress. "I got all of the Danimals in the cargo hold." I say as I walk over to the hatch and remotely unlock it. The Danimals walk down the ramp slowly towards us. An Elever comes down towards us and shows the other Danimals that George wasn't going to attack them. I lead them over to the newly-built sleeping quarters for the Danimals. They all settle in quickly. George says"well they seem to like it." at that moment the four Zepheon raptors walk up behind us. They go into the sleeping area and lie down on their special 4 sleeping areas that where created to their exact needs and their armour. "I have called a gathering between the generals." he says to me and I nod                                     "I will come to it" I reply and he leaves the room I go over to Sparky. I upgrade his air pirates on the underneath of his arms using some spare metal. 

I walk out after the raptor bowed his head in thanks and headed towards the meeting room. As I enter they all turn towards me and the fire cacti general (Toby) says "well look who decided to show up?" and several people nodded in agreement at this remark. "gee what on Cartoria did I do to you." I reply as I sit down in my seat next to George."anyway I have called you all here to discuss the war as it has almost become out of hand." he says to the generals. "we need to reinforce the base and also send an attack force around to the AI lab that is located to our north and will be led by half of you. After that, we will send a second squad also led by the other half of you generals to the shadow feather clan. Seniti help us if another solar system gets added to this stupid war."
