"you are dismissed" George says to everyone and we all leave the room. I notice that the stealth cacti general has rejoined the clan as the shadow cacti general. I go to the Danimal sleeping area and the raptors look up as I enter. When they see that it is me they continue chatting in their Zepheon language that was made up of jitters and weird popping noises. I had created a slight translator for their language. " shadow bird annoying" says Flicker and the others all nod in agreement at the statement. "me agree with you" agrees the second AI raptor and he starts to nod furiously. "yes my brother is quite annoying" I say and they all stare at me in amazement. "well I created a translator for your language so now I can properly understand you, kind of." I continue. "you know language?" The first AI raptor says. "master understands us!" they all say at once and they get up and spin round in a dance of joy.

George walks in and says "the AI group is going to set off soon. You are in the Shadow Feather group due to Sam being your brother and everything." Outside the base the AI group is waiting for George. He leaves the Danimal sleeping area and runs across the courtyard. When he exits the base on the north exit and joins the first army with half of the generals, they jump onto the troop transporters they stole from AI and start to head north. As they head over the destroyed Oasis of Octomida several mines go off and unfortunately kills around 20 cacti by the time they got to the AI base. They charged the base and lost 142 cacti in the attack however they did luckily capture the base and only a few warriors actually got away to tell AI that their outpost had been taken over by the cacti clan. A few generals stayed at the base and they set up a couple C-Bows on the roof of the Arcturus Industries outpost/lab. George and 100 cacti came back to the base and once he got back we set off for the shadow feather clan.

 I go and get into the modified commercial jet. I take off and begin to fly over to the Kapisi mother-ship. When I come in to land both thrusters get shot and stop working. I activate the nanotech reserves and the thrusters repair themselves. I make a controlled landing and then I exit the ship to find Sam waiting there. "Good to see you" I say "how is code-name: take-down going?"                                                                                                                                                "It is going great. Also I completely evacuated my main base thanks to your warning so..."                                                                                                                                                      " AI won't know what hit them" I reply finishing his sentence half way through.                    "Exactly." He says back. Unfortunately George came along secretly and saw me and Sam conversing. "So, what is this Dan?" He says as he jumps down from his stealth ship. "Is it treachery towards your own kind or is it something else" 

"Definitely something else" I say to him "Why would I be a traitor for Seniti's sake"              "You are conversing with the enemy." He says back "That does seem like treachery" When he finishes he fires two Oxydium infused spines at me. Both of them hit my robotic arms. They grew back around the spines and extracted the Oxydium from them. Then It liquidized it and put it in the storage container that fed the thrusters on my back. That would give me a huge boost when I needed it. "For Seniti's sake this is not treachery George. He has been faking being our enemy in order to ally with Arcturus Industries so that we can take them down once and for all" as I explain to him this, that Sam is actually our ally and has always been he lowers his palms and says "well how was I supposed to know that?" as he walks over to Sam and shakes his hand. "You weren't meant to know that until we had completed the Code-name: take-down."  I say to him in reply to his rhetorical question.
