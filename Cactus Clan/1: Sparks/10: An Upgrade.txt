As I walk back to my room I think 'I need a new suit.' and when I do get back I jog into the creating room and pick up grey matte steel and a large quantity of wiring and electronics. I activate the under suit creator and make a full black motor assisted Kevlar body suit to wear under the actual armour. I had installed a pipe that would give me molten metal into a sheet mould at the push of a button using the air pirates. I mould the steel into the shapes of the armour and then weld certain parts together. I add bearings on the joints in all directions to allow for full movement and a huge set of robotic arms with plasma blades on the ends and a set of miniature air pirates on the arms. The helmet had only a few spikes, it was a heavily armoured suit. The MKZepheon. At this point George walked in "I see that you are making a new suit." He says to me in a questioning tone. "Well you do have to prepare for the end of the world at some point, don't you?" I say in a calm voice as I finish off the last pieces of the suit.

"I call it the MKZepheon because I have been dealing with a large quantity of Danimals lately and thought that it would be fitting." I say to him. I activate the suit and get into it. This suit was not attached to the others in the same way, it was it's own entity. The raptors realise what i'm doing and they all come over to see. They recognize the name Zepheon on the forearm piece and that it was themed after them. I deactivate the suit and it opens up to allow me to exit it. I walk over to George and say "What do  you think?" in the same questioning tone that he always uses to ask me things. "Bam" there is an explosion outside. Me and the other generals race out only to be confronted by a huge 'Saminal' I command the air pirates to fire in such a way that they fly over it and sink into the solid ground on the other side of it. As the air pirates retract it forces the creature into the floor and makes it almost unable to move. "Well that is a big monster" George says to me as he runs out of the base. 

"Well I don't think that it will be bothering us at all from now on" I say to him as I stab the plasma blades through it's skull. Almost immediately it stops moving. "I can see that" he says.                                                                                                                                                     "I need to go and get the Danimals so that I can bring them here and set them up for battle." I say as I walk towards the base. I run through my labyrinth of tunnels and exit beside the rocket platform. I get into the rocket and activate my high G suit and helmet. I say "activate ignition sequence" and the rocket starts to ascend up to Vecron. Once I get there I exit the rocket and walk over to the hangers beside runway 4. They were huge with each one holding up to 200 ships and each runway has 5 of them. When I  get there I find the modified jet in the middle of the hanger as if waiting for me.

I get in to it and when I tell it to it takes off down the runway. As I am flying I realise that I forgot to help move the huge monster that had attacked the Cacti Fortress. Well I guess that George is going to have to do it himself. Suddenly, as I was thinking this, three grappling hooks were fired at the jet and one caught hold on the back fin. It yanked the jet backwards and I almost fell over with the force of it. 'Well that must be a bunch of bounty hunters' I think as a second yank tries to make me fall over once more. Two bounty hunters cut a hole in the roof using plasma knives. They jump into the jet. I grab either side of their heads and I smash them together and they both fall to the floor. I grab them with MK7 arms that I had switched to and I get out of the hole they made. I attached their collars to the grappling hook and detach it letting the two bounty hunters swing freely below the ship.
